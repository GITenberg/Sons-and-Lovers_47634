description: Tells the story of Paul Morel, a young artist growing into manhood in
  a British working-class community near the Nottingham coalfields. His mother Gertrude,
  unhappily married to Paul's hard-drinking father, devotes all her energies to her
  son. They develop a powerful and passionate relationship, but eventually tensions
  arise when Paul falls in love with a girl and seeks to escape his family ties. Torn
  between his desire for independence and his abiding attachment to his loving but
  overbearing mother, Paul struggles to define himself sexually and emotionally through
  his relationships with two women -- the innocent, old-fashioned Miriam Leivers,
  and the experienced, provocatively modern Clara Dawes.
